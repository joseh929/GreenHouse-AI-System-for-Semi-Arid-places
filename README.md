# 🌿 Smart Greenhouse AI System

This project simulates a **smart AI-powered greenhouse control system** designed for small-scale farmers in semi-arid regions. It uses environmental sensor inputs and rule-based AI to make real-time decisions on **watering**, **shading**, and **risk alerts**.

## 📌 Features

- 🌡️ Simulates environmental data (temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture, CO₂)
- 💧 Fuzzy logic for intelligent watering decisions
- 🌞 Light-based shading control using switch-case logic
- 🚨 AI-driven risk alerts and critical condition flags
- 🧠 (Bonus) Moving average for soil moisture trend analysis

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python greenhouse_ai.py
